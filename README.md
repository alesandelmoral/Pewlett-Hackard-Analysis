# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project: Pewlett Hackard Analysis

This project has the main object of analyze the status of employees to determine the number of retirements that this compa√±y will have, for this specific analysis we'll focus on the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This is a program in which the employees with more experienced employees will train new employees to fill future vacancies.
We will achieve all this with the help of databases

## Results

Through all this analysis about the future retirements we can notice the following points:

1. Our number of employees who have the Senior Engineer title is the biggest one followed by Senior Staff, and we only have 2 persons that have a manager titles.
2. The above represents an alarm for the areas that needs a Senior Enginieer or Senior Staff persons because this means that a lot off people who have this kind of titles will be retired and the company will need to replace them with equally qualified people.
3. In the case of the employees who are manager depends on the areas that have this position because regularly each area have only one manager from what we might suppose that only two areas will need to seach people who cover this profile.
4. For the mentorship program it's difficult to say that this will be successful because the number of the mentor are less comparing the number of positions that we need to replace from the retirements, in this case we only have 1,549 that will be trained who need to cover 90,398 positions, this will not cover all the retirements persons because of this the company needs hire more people to be trained.

## Summary

In our journey of analyzing our databases we have discovered quite a few things, but we can answer another question with two more queries, for example how many mentor do we have per title? or what is the proportion of men and women that will be retired?. We can answer this kind of question by query the data:

- Mentor per title
We can see in the next query that the largest number of mentor are in Senior Staff title followed by Engineer title, and the less number of mentors is on Assistant Engineer title:
